# FROWN

![forwn-screencast](frown.gif)

Frown provides a user-friendly interface to visualize all open connections that
a user has at a certain moment. For each of them, it performs a security check 
and reports the ones that might be non-secure. Think of it as a `lsof`, for
dummies, with batteries included.

## Limitations

Frown only supports Linux. If you would like to use it on another OS, please
submit an issue, or preferably a PR :).
