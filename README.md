# FROWN

![forwn-screencast](frown.gif)

Frown provides a user-friendly interface to visualize the status of all open connections
for a user at a certain moment. For each of connection, Frown performs a (naive) security check
and reports the ones that might not be secure. Think of it as a `lsof`, for dummies, with batteries included.

## Limitations

* Frown only supports Linux. If you would like to use it on another OS, please submit an issue, or preferably a PR :).
